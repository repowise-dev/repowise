"""Structured refactoring suggestions — the spine of the refactoring layer.

A ``RefactoringSuggestion`` is the deterministic, structured output of a
``RefactoringDetector`` (see ``registry.py``). It replaces the old static
suggestion *string* with a record carrying the concrete plan, the evidence
behind it, and the blast radius of applying it. Human-readable text is
rendered from this structure at the edges (CLI / MCP / web); the structure
is the source of truth, never a string.

The schema is shared across refactoring types: ``plan`` / ``evidence`` /
``blast_radius`` are open dicts whose shape is type-specific (documented per
detector), so later phases (Extract Helper, Move Method, Break Cycle) add a
type without touching this module. For Extract Class:

- ``plan`` = ``{"groups": [{"name": None, "methods": [...], "fields": [...]}]}``
  — one group per cohesive cluster the class should split into.
- ``evidence`` = ``{"lcom4": int, "method_count": int, "field_count": int,
  "wmc": int}`` — the cohesion/size signals that justify the split.
- ``blast_radius`` = ``{"dependents_count": int}`` — files importing the
  class's file that may need to follow the split.

For Extract Helper:

- ``plan`` = ``{"occurrences": [{"file": str, "line_start": int,
  "line_end": int}, ...], "suggested_site": {"module": str | None,
  "directory": str | None}, "duplicated_lines": int}`` — every site of the
  duplicated block and where the shared helper should live.
- ``evidence`` = ``{"occurrence_count": int, "duplicated_lines": int,
  "token_count": int, "co_change_count": int, "is_intra_file": bool}`` — the
  size + activity signals that justify extracting a helper.
- ``blast_radius`` = ``{"files": [...], "file_count": int,
  "co_change_count": int}`` — the other files that must change in lockstep.

For Move Method:

- ``plan`` = ``{"method": str, "from_class": str, "to_class": str,
  "to_file": str | None}`` — the feature-envy method and where it belongs.
- ``evidence`` = ``{"foreign_calls": int, "own_calls": int,
  "own_distance": float, "target_distance": float}`` — the Jaccard distances
  and call counts that prove the method is closer to ``to_class`` than its own.
- ``blast_radius`` = ``{"callers": int, "files": [...]}`` — who calls the
  method (they keep working, but the move touches both classes' files).

For Break Cycle:

- ``plan`` = ``{"cycle": [str, ...], "cut_edges": [{"from": str, "to": str},
  ...]}`` — the files in the import cycle and the minimal set of import edges
  to invert/abstract to break it (greedy MFAS).
- ``evidence`` = ``{"cycle_size": int, "edge_count": int,
  "cut_count": int}`` — the SCC size, total intra-cycle edges, and cut size.
- ``blast_radius`` = ``{"files": [...], "file_count": int}`` — every file in
  the cycle (breaking it is a multi-file change).

For Split File:

- ``plan`` = ``{"groups": [{"name": str | None, "symbols": [str, ...],
  "suggested_file": str}], "residual": {"symbols": [...]} | None,
  "shim_required": bool}`` — the cohesive groups the file should split into
  (each with a suggested filename), the shared-utility ``core`` left behind,
  and whether a back-compat re-export shim is needed (false for same-package
  Go, true for Python/TS).
- ``evidence`` = ``{"file_nloc": int, "symbol_count": int, "group_count": int,
  "modularity": float, "intra_edges": int, "cut_edges": int}`` — the size and
  decomposability signals that justify (and gate) the split.
- ``blast_radius`` = ``{"dependent_files": [str, ...], "dependent_count": int,
  "import_rewrites": int}`` — the external files referencing the split
  symbols and how many import edits the split implies.
