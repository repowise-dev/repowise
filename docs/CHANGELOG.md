## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Overview dashboard** (`/repos/[id]/overview`) — new landing page for each repository with:
  - Health score ring (composite of doc coverage, freshness, dead code, hotspot density, silo risk)
  - Attention panel highlighting items needing action (stale docs, high-risk hotspots, dead code)
  - Language donut chart, ownership treemap, hotspots mini-list
  - Decisions timeline, module minimap (interactive graph summary)
  - Quick actions panel (sync, full re-index, generate CLAUDE.md, export)
  - Active job banner with live progress polling
- **Background pipeline execution** — `POST /api/repos/{id}/sync` and `POST /api/repos/{id}/full-resync` now launch the full pipeline in the background instead of only creating a pending job. Concurrent runs on the same repo return HTTP 409.
- **Shared persistence layer** (`core/pipeline/persist.py`) — `persist_pipeline_result()` extracted from CLI, reused by both CLI and server job executor
- **Job executor** (`server/job_executor.py`) — background task that runs `run_pipeline()`, writes progress to the `GenerationJob` table, and persists all results
- **Server crash recovery** — stale `running` jobs are reset to `failed` on server startup
- **Async pipeline improvements** — `asyncio.wrap_future` for file I/O, `asyncio.to_thread` for graph building and thread pool shutdown, periodic `asyncio.sleep(0)` yields during parsing
- **Health score utility** (`web/src/lib/utils/health-score.ts`) — composite health score computation, attention item builder, and language aggregation for the overview dashboard

### Changed
- `init_cmd.py` refactored to use shared `persist_pipeline_result()` instead of inline persistence logic
- Pipeline orchestrator uses async-friendly patterns to keep the event loop responsive during ingestion
- Sidebar and mobile nav updated to include "Overview" link

- Monorepo scaffold: uv workspace with `packages/core`, `packages/cli`, `packages/server`, `packages/web`
- Provider abstraction layer: `BaseProvider`, `GeneratedResponse`, `ProviderError`, `RateLimitError`
- `AnthropicProvider` with prompt caching support
- `OpenAIProvider` with OpenAI Chat Completions API
- `OllamaProvider` for local offline inference (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- `LiteLLMProvider` for 100+ models via LiteLLM proxy
- `MockProvider` for testing without API keys
- `RateLimiter`: async sliding-window RPM + TPM limits with exponential backoff
- `ProviderRegistry`: dynamic provider loading with custom provider registration
- CI pipeline: GitHub Actions matrix on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Pre-commit hooks: ruff lint + format, mypy, standard file checks
- **Folder exclusion** — three-layer system for skipping paths during ingestion:
  - `FileTraverser(extra_exclude_patterns=[...])` — pass gitignore-style patterns at construction time; applied to both directory pruning and file-level filtering
  - Per-directory `.repowiseIgnore` — traverser loads one from each visited directory (like git's per-directory `.gitignore`); patterns are relative to that directory and cached for efficiency
  - `repowise init --exclude/-x PATTERN` — repeatable CLI flag; patterns are merged with `exclude_patterns` from `config.yaml` and persisted back to `.repowise/config.yaml`
  - `repowise update` reads `exclude_patterns` from `config.yaml` automatically
  - Web UI **Excluded Paths** section on `/repos/[id]/settings`: chip editor, Enter-to-add input, six quick-add suggestions (`vendor/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `*.generated.*`, `**/fixtures/**`), empty-state message, gitignore-syntax tooltip; saved via `PATCH /api/repos/{id}` as `settings.exclude_patterns`
  - `helpers.save_config()` now round-trips `config.yaml` to preserve all existing keys when updating provider/model/embedder; accepts optional `exclude_patterns` keyword argument
  - `scheduler.py` logs `repo.settings.exclude_patterns` in polling fallback as preparation for future full-sync wiring
- 13 new unit tests in `tests/unit/ingestion/test_traverser.py` covering `extra_exclude_patterns` and per-directory `.repowiseIgnore` behaviour
